                    <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
                    <p> I'm Mariele Joyce R. Gillang, and it's wonderful to connect with you digitally! I am a first-year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Bukidnon State University. I formerly resided in Zone 2 Barangay 11 Impalambong, Malaybalay City. 

                        I frequently lose myself in the engrossing realms of manga and anime during my free time. I adore the inventiveness that these media bring to life, whether it is through the complex narratives or the exquisitely animated sequences. I enjoy binge-watching Netflix series, ranging from drama to science fiction, while I'm not sulking in the realm of animation.
                         
                        My ability to adapt and learn new things is one of my strongest professional traits. I do best in dynamic settings with lots of new information to learn. Being an eager student has not only helped me advance in my work but also given me the freedom to pursue a variety of interests and hobbies.

                        Another essential component of my skill set is adaptability. I appreciate pushing myself to take on new challenges and see change as a chance for personal development. Because of my capacity to adapt, I have been able to succeed in a variety of professional jobs and pursue a wide range of hobbies, weaving a rich tapestry of experiences.
                        
                        That's why I'm always eager for the next adventure, both personally and professionally, whether it's learning something new, improving my learning and adaptability abilities, or immersing myself in a new anime series. Anticipating the voyage that is ahead!
